# Real-Time Clock with Alarm Using DS3231

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time clock (RTC) with alarm functionality using the DS3231 module and an Arduino. The DS3231 is a highly accurate RTC with an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator, making it ideal for applications requiring precise timekeeping and alarms.

## Features

- **Accurate Timekeeping**: Tracks the current date and time with high precision.
- **Alarm Functionality**: Set and trigger alarms at specified times.
- **Display Support**: (Optional) Interface with an LCD or OLED display to show the current time and alarm status.
- **User Interaction**: (Optional) Adjust the time and set alarms via serial commands or buttons.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno/Nano**: Microcontroller to interface with the DS3231 and manage alarm functions.
- **DS3231 RTC Module**: Provides accurate timekeeping and alarm features.
- **LCD/OLED Display**: (Optional) For displaying the time and alarm status.
- **Push Buttons**: (Optional) For user interaction to set the time and alarms.
- **Buzzer or Speaker**: (Optional) For audible alarm notifications.
- **Power Supply**: To power the Arduino and connected components.

## Circuit Diagram

Refer to the `circuit_diagram.pdf` file for the detailed wiring instructions, including connections between the DS3231 module, Arduino, display, and optional components.

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect the DS3231 module to the Arduino following the circuit diagram.
   - Connect the optional display and buzzer if used.
   - Ensure proper power connections.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary Arduino libraries for the DS3231 and display (if used).
   - Upload the Arduino code (`RTCWithAlarm.ino`) to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Set the current time and configure alarms through the code or user interface.

4. **Operation**:
   - The system will keep track of time and activate the alarm at the programmed time.
   - Adjust time and alarm settings as needed.

## Code

The Arduino code is provided in the `RTCWithAlarm.ino` file. It includes:
- Initialization of the DS3231 RTC module.
- Timekeeping and alarm setup.
- Alarm triggering and optional display updates.
